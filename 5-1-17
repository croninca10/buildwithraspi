# We began work on our VPN project. After spending time researching different options, we chose PiVPN which is essentially
# OpenVPN formatted for a RaspberryPi
# first we did 

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

#then we installed with 

curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash

#after installation we went through the configuration menu changing settings relating to ip address, ports, and encryption strenght.
#during configuration the system froze and I had to manually reboot by unpluging the pi
#after reboot I could no longer connect the pi.
