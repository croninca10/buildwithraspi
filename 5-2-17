#Continued to have issues with reconnecting the wifi from the crash so I wiped my SD card and re-installed Raspbian OS
#After flashing I was able to connect to wifi
#I was still unable to ssh into my pi and I had the following error

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:mgZodUZiP1x8v4Q2sPdjBEv+Wh0GIMwZ+/gnCNz1rmQ.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /Users/croninca/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /Users/croninca/.ssh/known_hosts:2
ECDSA host key for 134.181.105.12 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.

#using emacs I was able to erase host keys and eventually ssh into my pi

bobcat-127-126:~ croninca$ emacs /Users/croninca/.ssh/known_hosts

# Because I was starting on a fresh system I had to redo emailing ip address process.
# I then re-installed PiVPN

curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash

#We elected for our VPN to have 2048-bit encryption which took the remained of the class time to install

Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: ./vars
Generating DH parameters, 2048 bit long safe prime, generator 2
This is going to take a long time
